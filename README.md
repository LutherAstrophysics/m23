# M23 Python Helpers

This is a WIP towards implementing a library of the core code we use
in our astronomy research work on various works related to M23
culster.

We're writing most modules in python because of support of
pre-existing freely available libraries like numpy, scipy, astropy.

The followings are what we have so far, excluding helper utilities.

|Name | Description |
|-----| ------------|
|fits reader| reads a fits file and converts it into array (numpy array specifically)|
|fits to csv| convert a fit file into csv|
